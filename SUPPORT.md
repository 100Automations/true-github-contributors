# Support

Detailed documentation is planned to be included in the [readme](https://github.com/100Automations/true-github-contributors/blob/mixin/readme.md).

For any questions, please feel free to [slack me individualy](https://app.slack.com/team/UNAQGKW91) or drop into the [100 Automations slack](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/C018S5TCQE7) and mention me to ask any questions.

For any issues and non-security related bugs that feel like they could be resolved through developement, please open a detailed issue on the issue and why. This way, there can be room to have a productive discussion before any changes are made. It can be discussed if the change is a good fit for this project, fine tune goals, and more.

If you would like to contribute code in response to any issues or support related needs, see the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/100Automations/true-github-contributors/blob/mixin/CONTRIBUTING.md).
